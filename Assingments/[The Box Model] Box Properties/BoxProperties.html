    <p>Gjergj Kastrioti (c. 1405 – 17 January 1468), commonly known as Skanderbeg, was an Albanian feudal lord and
        military commander who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia,
        Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia.

        A member of the noble Kastrioti family, he was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman court. He graduated from the
        Enderun School and entered the service of the Ottoman sultan Murad II (r. 1421–1444) for the next twenty years.
        His rise through the ranks culminated in his appointment as sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Dibra in 1440. During the
        Battle of Nish in 1443, he deserted the Ottomans and became the ruler of Krujë and nearby areas extending from
        Petrelë to Modrič. In March 1444, he established the League of Lezhë, with support from local noblemen, and
        unified the small Albanian principalities.

        In 1451, through the Treaty of Gaeta, he recognized de jure the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Naples over
        Albania, ensuring a protective alliance, although he remained a de facto independent ruler. In 1460–61, he
        supported Ferdinand I of Naples (r. 1458–1494) in his wars and led an Italian expedition against John II of
        Anjou (r. 1453–1470). In 1463, he was earmarked to be the chief commander of the crusading forces of Pope Pius
        II, but the Pope died while the armies were still gathering and the greater European crusade never eventuated.
        Together with Venetians, he fought against the Ottomans during the First Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) until
        his death.

        He ranks high in the military history of that time as the most persistent—and ever-victorious—opponent of the
        Ottoman Empire in its heyday. He became a central figure in the Albanian National Awakening in the 19th century.
        He is honored in modern Albania, and is commemorated with many monuments and cultural works. Skanderbeg's
        military skills presented a major obstacle to Ottoman expansion, and many in western Europe considered him to be
        a model of Christian resistance against Muslims. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
