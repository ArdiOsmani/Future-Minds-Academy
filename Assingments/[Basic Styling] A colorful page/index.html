            <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons on Earth.
                Outside
                the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or
                March
                (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and
                the
                temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses
                until
                the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main
                features
                in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare
                to
                shed.

                Date definitions
                Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", while others with a longer temperature lag
                treat the
                equinox as the start of autumn. In the English-speaking world of high latitude countries, autumn
                traditionally began with Lammas Day and ended around Hallowe'en, the approximate mid-points between
                midsummer,
                the autumnal equinox, and midwinter. Meteorologists (and Australia and most of the temperate countries
                in
                the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being
                September,
                October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.

                In the higher latitude countries in the Northern Hemisphere, autumn traditionally starts with the
                September
                equinox (21 to 24 September) and ends with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December). Popular culture in
                the
                United States associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of
                autumn;
                certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date. As daytime and
                nighttime
                temperatures decrease, trees change colour and then shed their leaves. Persians celebrate the beginning
                of
                the autumn on Mehregan.

                Under the traditional East Asian solar term system, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or
                about 7
                November. In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann,
                are
                September, October, and November. However, according to the Irish Calendar, which is based on ancient
                Gaelic
                traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September, and October, or possibly a few days
                later,
                depending on tradition. In the Irish language, September is known as Meán Fómhair ("middle of autumn")
                and
                October as Deireadh Fómhair ("end of autumn"). Late Roman Republic scholar Marcus Terentius Varro
                defined autumn as lasting from the third day before the Ides of Sextilis (August 11) to the fifth day
                before the
                Ides of November (November 9).</p>

            <h2>Fall, Leaves, Fall - A Poem</h2>
            <p>
                Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
                <br>Lengthen night and shorten day;
                <br>Every leaf speaks bliss to me
                <br> Fluttering from the autumn tree.
                <br>I shall smile when wreaths of snow
                <br>Blossom where the rose should grow;
                <br>I shall sing when night’s decay
                <br>Ushers in a drearier day.
